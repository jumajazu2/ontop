# ontop - Home Assistant Monitoring Tool

"ontop" is a lightweight Home Assistant viewer, currently available for Windows.
It is intended to provide an unobtrusive way of constatnly seeing/monitoring key entities from a Home Assistant system, displayed in a (small) customisable window on top of any other windows.
To check the key entities, the user does not have to switch to a browser windows to check the complete Home Assistant dashboard, but has the selected entities available at a glance.
